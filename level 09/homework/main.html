<h1>Introduction to Programming Languages</h1>

<h2>Python</h2>
<p><strong>Python</strong> is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's commonly used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation.</p>
<p>Created by <em>Guido van Rossum</em> in <b>1989</b>, Python emphasizes code readability and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to other languages.</p>

<h2>Java</h2>
<p><strong>Java</strong> is a class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It's widely used for building enterprise-scale applications, mobile apps (Android), and web applications.</p>
<p>Created by <em>James Gosling</em> at <b>Sun Microsystems</b> in <b>1995</b>, Java's "write once, run anywhere" philosophy makes it a popular choice for cross-platform development.</p>

<h2>C++</h2>
<p><strong>C++</strong> is a general-purpose programming language known for its efficiency, performance, and flexibility. It's widely used in systems programming, game development, and high-performance applications.</p>
<p>Developed by <em>Bjarne Stroustrup</em> at <b>Bell Labs</b> in <b>1985</b>, C++ is an extension of the C programming language with added features such as classes and objects.</p>

<h2>Ruby</h2>
<p><strong>Ruby</strong> is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and productivity. It's commonly used for web development, particularly with the Ruby on Rails framework.</p>
<p>Created by <em>Yukihiro Matsumoto</em> in <b>1995</b>, Ruby is designed with the principle of "developer happiness" in mind, emphasizing human-friendly syntax.</p>
